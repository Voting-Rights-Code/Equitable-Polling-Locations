# Equitable-Polling-Locations

The software component of this project is a tool that chooses an optimal set of polling locations from a set of potential locations. Optionally, it also gives a "best case scenario" by searching among the centroids of census block groups, which don't correspond to buildings or street corners, but are suggestive of what an ideal distribution might look like.

Unlike other optimization tools out there, which minimize the mean distance traveled or the maximal distance traveled, this tool (which minimizes the Kolm-Pollack, or KP, distance) does a bit of both. For a detailed description of the methods used here, see
[Horton et. al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15452).
For more on the Kolm-Pollack distance and why it is suitable for optimizing with equity in mind, see the following papers: [Sherrif, Macguire](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/risa.13562); [Logan et. al.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0198971520303239); [Kolm, 1976a](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0022053176900375); [Kolm, 1976b](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0022053176900685).

The ```result analysis``` folder is an illustrative example of the type of analysis that can be done with the data generated by this code. The analysis code is in R.


### Example
In the following table, the first three rows have the same mean, while the last three rows have the same maximal distance traveled. The KP minimizing optimization allows the user to set an *aversion to inequality (beta)* parameter that defines a tradeoff between mean and standard deviation of the distances traveled. For a large enough beta, the optimization will choose the last distribution. For a smaller beta, it will choose the second row.

| Distances traveled  | Mean minimizing | Max minimizing | KP minimizing|
| ----- | ------ | ----- | ------ |
|.25, .25, .25, .25, 4 | Yes | | |
| .5, .5, .5, .5, 3| Yes | Yes | Depending on beta |
| .25, .25, .5, 1, 3 | Yes | Yes | Depending on beta |
| .5, .5, .5, .75, 3 |  | Yes |  |

### How it works
Given a set of existing and candidate polling locations, output the most equitable (by Kolm-Pollak distance) set of polling locations. The outputs of this model can be used to measure inequity among different racial groups in terms of access to polls (measured solely in terms of distance) and investigate how changes in choices and number of polling locations would change these inequities.

The algorithm for this model is as follows:
1. Create a list of potential polling locations
    1. Start with a list of historical polling locations
    1. Add to this a list of  buildings where one could feasibly site future polling locations
    1. Combine this data with a list of "best case scenario" polling locations, modeled by census block *group* centroids
1. Compute the distance from the centroid of each census block (representing residences) to each potential polling location (building or best case scenario)
    1. We average over census blocks rather than individual houses for computational feasibility
1. Compute the Kolm-Pollack weight from each block group to each polling location
    1. KP_factor  = e^(- beta * alpha * distance)
        1. beta is a user defined parameter
        1. alpha is a data derived normalization factor (alpha = (\sum (block population * distance_to_closest_poll)) / (\sum (block_population * distance_to_closest_poll^2))
    1. The KP_factor plays the role of a weighted distance in a standard objective function.
        1. The exponential in the KP_factor penalizes inequality in distances traveled
        1. For instance a group of 5 people all having to travel 1 mile to a polling location would have a lower KP_factor than a situation where 4 people travel 1/2 a mile while the fifth travels 3, even though the average distance traveled in both cases is the same.
1. Choose whether to minimize the average distance or the inequity penalized score (y_EDE) in the model
    1. Set beta = 0 for average distance
        1. In this case, minimize the average distance traveled
    1. Set beta in [-2, 0) for the inequity penalized score (y_EDE). The lower the beta, the greater penalty to inequality
        1. In this case, minimize (\sum block population * KP_factor)/ county population
1. Minimize the above according to the following constraints:
    1. Can only have a user specified number of polling locations open
    1. A user defined bound on the number of new locations
        1. Some maximal percent allowed to be new
        1. Some minimal percent that must have been a polling location in the past
        1. This can be easily modified to accommodate other needs (for example, require existing locations to remain open)
    1. Each census block can only be matched to one polling location
    1. Each census block must be matched to a single open precinct
    1. A user defined overcrowding constraint
1. The model returns a list of matchings between census blocks and polling locations, along with the distance between the two, and a demographic breakdown of the population.
1. The model then uses this matching and demographic data to compute a new data derived scaling factor (alpha), which it then uses to compute the inequity penalized score (y_EDE) for the matched system.

A FEW THINGS TO NOTE:
1. Currently, this model is run on census data, which counts voting age population. We make no assumptions about eligibility to vote, either in terms of citizenship, local disqualification laws or voter registration status.
2. When this model reports racial demographics, it uses Census categories for race and ethnicity. Namely, Ethnicity (Hispanic / Non-Hispanic) is orthogonal to race in the census data. Therefore, one may be Hispanic and Asian at the same time.

# To install
1. Clone main branch of Equitable-Polling-Locations
    1. This repo uses lfs. This can be downloaded from [https://git-lfs.com/].
        1. Download the appropriate version from this website and follow the instructions included there.
        1. If those instructions don't work, (as may be the case on Linux or MacOS), run ```sudo ./install.sh``` after downloading the file, then follow the instructions above. See [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58796472/git-lfs-is-not-a-git-command-on-macos).
1. Install conda if you do not have it already
    1. This program uses SCIP as an optimizer, which is easily installed using Conda, but not using pip. (SCIP installation will be completed below by installing 'environment.yml')
    1. If you do not have conda installed already, use the relevant instructions [here](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html)
1. Create and activate conda environment. (Note, on a Windows machine, this requires using Anaconda Prompt.)
    1. `$ conda env create -f environment.yml`
    1. `$ conda activate equitable-polls`


# To run
From command line:

First activate the environment if not done so already:

```conda activate equitable-polls```

* In the directory of the Equitable-Polling-Locations git repo:
    * python ./model_run_cli.py -c NUM -l LOG_FILE ./path/to/config/file.yaml
        * NUM = number of cores to use for simultaneous runs (recommend <=4 for most laptops)
        * LOG_FILE = Where to put log file. Must exist, or will not run
        * path to config file accepts wild cards to set of sequential runs
        * **Examples**
            * See ```python ./model_run_cli.py -h```
            * To run all expanded configs, parallel processing 4 at a time, and write log files out to the logs
    directory:  
    ```python ./model_run_cli.py -c4 -l logs ./Gwinnett_GA_configs/Gwinnett_config_expanded_*.yaml```
            * To run all full configs run one at a time, extra logging printed to the console, and write log files out to the logs directory:
                ```python ./model_run_cli.py -vv -l logs ./Gwinnett_GA_configs/Gwinnett_config_full_*.yaml```
            * To run only the full_11 and write log files out to the logs directory:
        ```python ./model_run_cli.py -l logs ./Gwinnett_GA_configs/Gwinnett_config_full_11.yaml```
        * NOTE: BEWARE OF CAPITALIZATION. Both ./Gwinnett_GA_configs/Gwinnett* and ./Gwinnett_Ga_configs/Gwinnett* (note capitalization) will run on Windows. However, due to string replacement work in other parts of the programs, the former is preferred.
  

From Google Colab:
* For example, follow the the instructions in [this file](./Colab_runs/colab_Gwinnett_expanded_multi_11_12_13_14_15.ipynb) (To be accessed in the directory of the Equitable-Polling-Locations git repo)
# Input files
There are six files needed to run this program. The current Repo contains these files for Gwinnett County, GA.

* There are 4 files from the census needed for each county:
    1. block level P3 data for a county (racial breakdown of voting age population)
    1. block level P4 data for a county (ethnicity breakdown of voting age population)
    1. block shape files
    1. block group shape files
* There is one *manually generated* file for each county
    * previous and potential polling locations for a country
* There is one config file needed as an argument to run this file


If you are interested in only running results for  Gwinnett County, no further action is needed. If you are interested in running a county for which you do not have the above data, the software will notify you that the necessary data is missing. In that case, instructions for downloading or creating these files and their formats are given here.

The columns of this data set should be named and formatted as
|Column Name | Definition | Example |
| ----- | ------ | ----- |
|Location | Name of the actual or potential polling location | 'Bethesda Senior Center' |
| Address | Street Address of the actual or potential polling location| (format flexible) '788 Hillcrest Rd NW, Lilburn, GA 20047' |
|Location Type | If polling location, must have a year when it was used | 'EV_2022_2020' or 'General_2020' or 'Primary_2022_2020_2018' or 'DropBox_2022'|
| | If potential location, has a 'location type' category and the word 'Potential' (case sensitive) | 'Community Center - Potential' |
| Lat, Long | Comma separated concatenation of latitude and longitude (can be read off of google maps by right clicking on the location marker for the address.) | '33.964717796407434, -83.85827288222517' |

### **CONFIG_FOLDER/County_config_DESCRIPTOR.yaml**
These are the config files for the various runs.

Example path: Gwinnett_GA_configs/Gwinnett_config_full_11.yaml

Recommended convention: Each config folder should only have one parameter changing. For example, DeKalb_GA_no_bg_school_config should contain only (and all) runs with block groups and schools in the bad list, changing only the number of desired polling locations
  * Mandatory arguments
    * location: County_ST. This variable is used throughout to name files
    * year: List of years one wants to consider actual polling locations for. E.g. ['2022', '2020']
    * bad_types: List of location types not to be considered in this model. 
        * E.g. ['Election Day Loc - Potential', 'bg_centroid' ]
        * Must be labels already existing in the data
    * beta: In [-2, 0]. Aversion to inequality. If 0, this computes the mean distance. The further away from 0, the greater the aversion to inequality.
    * time_limit: maximal number of minutes that the optimizer will run
    * capacity: >= 1. A multiplicative factor that indicates how much more than *population/precincts_open* a precinct is allowed to be allotted

  * Optional arguments
    * precincts_open: number of precincts to be assigned. Default: number of existing polling locations
    * max_min_mult: >= 1. A scalar to limit the search radius to match polling locations. If this is too small, the optimizer may not find a solution. Default: 1
    * maxpctnew = In [0,1]. The percent of new locations allowed to be matched. Default = 1
    * minpctold = In [0,1]. The percent of existing locations allowed to be matched. Default = 0
    * penalized_sites: List of potential polling locations (subset of those considered in run) that are less desireable. A site in this list should be selected only if it improves access by x meters, where x is calculated according to the problem data. (See https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2401.15452 for more information.) This option generates three additional log files: two for additional calls to the optimization solver ("...model2.log", "...model3.log") third ("...penalty.log") providing statistics related to the penalty heuristic.

# Intermediate dataset

### **datasets/polling/County_ST/County_ST.csv**:
This is the main data set that the optimizer uses. It includes polling locations from previous years, potential polling locations, and block group centroids, as well as distances from block centroids to the above.

# Output datasets

For each set of parameters specified in a config file (CONFIG_FOLDER/County_config_DESCRIPTOR.yaml), the program produces 4 output files.
* If the file was run via Google Colab, the outputs are written in the folder Colab_results/County_ST_DESCRIPTOR_result
    * The output files have the names:
        * County_config_DESCRIPTOR_edes.csv
        * County_config_DESCRIPTOR_precinct_distances.csv
        * County_config_DESCRIPTOR_residence_distances.csv
        * County_config_DESCRIPTOR_result.csv

* If the file was run via command line, the outputs are written in the folder Gwinnett_GA_results/
    * The output files have the names:
        * CONFIG_FOLDER.County_config_DESCRIPTOR_edes.csv
        * CONFIG_FOLDER.County_config_DESCRIPTOR_precinct_distances.csv
        * CONFIG_FOLDER.County_config_DESCRIPTOR_residence_distances.csv
        * CONFIG_FOLDER.County_config_DESCRIPTOR_result.csv

The four files can be described as follow:
* *_edes.csv (demographic level ede scores)
    * For each demographic group (asian, black, hispanic, native, population, white), this table records the
        * demo_pop, the total population of that demographic in the county
        * average distance traveled by the members of that demographic: average_distance = weighted_distance / demo_pop
        * the y_EDE for the demographic: y_EDE = -1/(beta * alpha)*log(avg_KP_weight)
            * where avg_KP_weight= (\sum demo_res_obj_summand)/demo_pop
* *_precinct_distances.csv (distances traveled to each precinct by demographic)
    * For each demographic group (asian, black, hispanic, native, population, white), and identified polling location (id_dest), this table records the
        * demo_pop, the total population of that demographic matched to that location
        * average distance traveled by the members of that demographic: average_distance = weighted_distance / demo_pop
* *_demographic_distances.csv (distances traveled by members of a census block to each polling location by demographic)
    * This is an interim table needed to create the *_ede.csv table
    * For each demographic group (asian, black, hispanic, native, population, white), and census block (id_orig), this table records the
        * demo_pop, the total population of that demographic matched to that location
        * average distance traveled by the members of that demographic: average_distance = weighted_distance / demo_pop
* *_result.csv (a combined table of census block, matched polling location, distance, and demographic information)
    * This is a source table for the above three
    * For each census block (id_orig), this table records the
        * polling location (id_dest) to which the census block is matched
        * the distance to this polling location
        * The County_ST of the run
        * the address of the the polling location (if it exists)
        * the coordinates of the block centroid (orig_lat and orig_lon) and the coordinates of the destination (dest_lat and dest_lon)
        * population of each of the demographic groups per census block
        * It also reports weighted distance and KP factor, which are population level variables, but these columns are never used and should be removed in a future release.
