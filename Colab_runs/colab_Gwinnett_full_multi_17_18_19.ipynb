The changes will have to be explicitly written back to Github. \n","\n","## Memory\n","In order to run these notebooks, [Colab Pro plan](https://colab.research.google.com/signup) or higher is required.  Full instance runs of these notebooks can use up to 35-40 GB of ram, so using the free tier for full runs will cause these notebook to crash.  \n","\n","### High-RAM Instance\n","In order to enable a high ram instance got to the menu:\n","1. Got to the menu Runtime -> Change runtime type\n","1. Under \"Shape\" click \"High-RAM\" then click Save\n","\n","If High-RAM is not available, make sure a Pro plan or higher is subscribed.\n","\n","### High-RAM Instance Costs\n","Running a Colab High-RAM instance costs about .12 compute units hour.\n","\n","## Background execution\n","Notebooks in Colab require the browser to stay open unless a [Colab Pro+ or higher](https://colab.research.google.com/signup) is used.\n","\n","## Browser Refresh\n","Refreshing the browser will cause the current colab notebook to re-download the notebook from github and clear out any changes.  Note this will not clear out the data stored in the local drive.\n","\n","## Run Times\n","Google Colab will only run notebook cells for up to 12 hours using a Pro plan.  A Pro+ plan will allow a notebook cell to run up to 24 hours.\n","\n","Full instance runs can individually take around 3.5 hours to complete.\n","\n","## Idle instances\n","Google Colab instances have 90 minute timeout.  Once timed out, all data stored in the Colab instance will be deleted.  All needed data should be downloaded or copied to an external drive.  (As of this writing all cells automatically copy data out to the shared drive upon completion .)\n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# Notebook Setup"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":210787,"status":"ok","timestamp":1695516036819,"user":{"displayName":"Chad Rosenberg","userId":"11884604974944202333"},"user_tz":420},"id":"AaEWaDM40PmJ","outputId":"cc372fd3-e675-43f9-bd22-d4b4e282e368"},"outputs":[],"source":["#@title Install the required python libs - Note: running this cell will report a notebook crash, this is expected\n","!pip install -q condacolab\n","import condacolab\n","condacolab.install()\n","\n","# The following install command will restart the notebook kernel to import the newly installed libs,\n","# this restart will cause the notebook to report a crash.
