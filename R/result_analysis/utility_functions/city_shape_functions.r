######## Terminology and notes for this file ########
# Shape refers to either block or block group geometries, read from TIGER data
# Boundary refers to city lines, but could be a different sub county unit
# Intersecting / Contained logic is needed because the city lines don't respect
#       census lines. There is a question of whether one wants to consider 
#       blocks or block groups in the city or those that intersect it
