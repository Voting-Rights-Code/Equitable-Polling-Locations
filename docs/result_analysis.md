# Result Analysis
After the data is generated by the optimizer, a function in the `result_analysis/` folder generates graphs, maps, regressions etc. for the resulting datasets. The output images and .csvs for a config_set are placed in the folder `result_analysis_outputs/<config_set>` folder as well as the Google CloudStorage bucket indicated in the file.

## Analysis generating scripts

`R/result_analysis/Basic_analysis.r` runs the core set of graphs, regression and maps. This script is set up to compare historical polling location data with potential polling configurations. However, given the correct configurations, it can run for just historical data.

For other variations for different purposes, see the scripts in `R/result_analysis/deprecated`, which are no longer maintained, but preserved for reference. 

**NOTE:** In order for these files to work, only one field may vary per config_set.

## To run

1. put `Rscript` in `PATH` for your system
1. Create a config file for the pair of config_sets one wants to compare (or just the historical data) and save in `R/result_analysis/Basic_analysis_configs/`
    1. See `R\result_analysis\Basic_analysis_configs\Berkeley_County_original.r` as an example of a config for just historic data
    1. See `R\result_analysis\Basic_analysis_configs\Dougherty_County_original_and_log.r` for an example of a config file that compares two config_sets
1. From terminal, run `Rscript R/result_analysis/Basic_analysis.r name_of_config.r`. Note, name_of_config is only the file name, not the path. E.g `Berkeley_County_original.r`.


## General Workflow

Whether pulling from the database or csv, the analysis software compiles the relevant data as follows:
1. Pull all the data from the indicated config_sets
1. Performs safety checks
    1. That the data pulled varies by only one field per set
    1. That the data contains the locations of interest
1. Pulls out a Driving and a Log Flag from the config file
1. Reads and coallates the output data by the four tables
    1. This includes and automatic generation of a descriptor field based off the field that varies
    1. This descriptor field may need to be mannually changed, depending on the specifics of the data.
1. Prepare data for maps:
    1. Combine output data with block group level demographic data
    1. Calculate block group level distances 
    1. Split data by config_name, config_set pairs 
1. Prepare data for regressions
    1. Calculate population density data by block group and demographic and aggregate up to the block group level.
1. Graphs are made and stored
    1. edes and average distances by population are plotted together for an indicated set of config_names
    1. edes by demographic are plogged for a given config_set
    1. a plot of which precincts are chosen, for which optimization, how many people are assigned for all config_names in a config_set
    1. A histogram comparing the distributions of how far people travel for an indicated set of config_names
1. Maps are made and stored
    1. A heat map of how far people have to travel with polling locations indicated
    1. A head map of how far people of a given demographic have to travel. 
    1. Optimized precinct maps, according to which blocks are mapped to which polling location
1. Regressions are made and stored
    1. Average distance traveled in each block group is plotted against the population density, by race


# Analysis and Google Cloud Storage

By default output from R analysis will be written to Google Cloud Storage under the bucket `equitable-polling-analysis` under the folder `result_analysis`. This bucket can be browsed in the [Google Cloud Storage](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/equitable-polling-analysis;tab=objects?forceOnBucketsSortingFiltering=true&project=equitable-polling-locations&prefix=&forceOnObjectsSortingFiltering=false) console, if access is grated.

## Database

When running analsyis in R, such as the `.../result_analysis/Basic_analsysis.r`, data can be read from the local csv files or from
a BigQuery dataset.  If data is desired from the database, set READ_FROM_CSV to FALSE, such as:

```R
READ_FROM_CSV = FALSE
```

Database authentication will happen automatically via the [`bigrquery` R library](https://bigrquery.r-dbi.org/).

To set which database to use, set the `PROJECT`, `DATASET`, and `BILLING` variables, such as the following:

```R
PROJECT = "equitable-polling-locations"
DATASET = "equitable_polling_locations_prod"
BILLING = PROJECT
```

## Google CloudStorage

To write the output of analysis to the Google Cloud Cloud storage, at the end of the analysis file make sure the following variables are set.

| Variable Name               | Description                                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| STORAGE_BUCKET              | The google cloud storage bucket to write to.                                                |
| CLOUD_STORAGE_ANALYSIS_NAME | The name of the folder to write all the analysis to under the folder `.../result_analysis/` |


And at the end of the R file, add the following line:

```R
upload_graph_files_to_cloud_storage()
```

Authentication will happen via the [`googleCloudStorageR` R library](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=googleCloudStorageR).  Before running the R analysis, you must login via the [gcloud command line tool](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install-sdk).  One installed, run the following:

```
gcloud auth application-default login
```


Example:
```R
# ...

STORAGE_BUCKET = "equitable-polling-analysis"
CLOUD_STORAGE_ANALYSIS_NAME = "Basic_analysis.r"

# ...

###maps####

sapply(orig_list_prepped, function(x)make_bg_maps(x, 'map'))

sapply(orig_list_prepped, function(x)make_demo_dist_map(x, 'population'))
sapply(orig_list_prepped, function(x)make_demo_dist_map(x, 'black'))
sapply(orig_list_prepped, function(x)make_demo_dist_map(x, 'white'))
sapply(orig_list_prepped, function(x)make_demo_dist_map(x, 'hispanic'))
sapply(orig_list_prepped, function(x)make_demo_dist_map(x, 'asian'))

upload_graph_files_to_cloud_storage()
```

By setting the above, any graph file written to using the functions found in `.../result_analysis/graph_functions.R` and `.../result_analysis/graph_functions.R` will be written locally in the `.../result_analysis/` as well as to Cloud Storage under the folder `equitable-polling-analysis:result_analysis/Basic_analysis.r/[DATESTAMP]/...`.
