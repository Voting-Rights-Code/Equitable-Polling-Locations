# Code of Conduct for Contributing to Voting Rights Code
Welcome to Voting Rights Code. Thank you for considering working with us. If you are just browsing, reach out. We'd love to talk to you. 

## TL;DR
1. Communicate
    1. We can't fix a problem if we don't know it needs fixing.  
2. Everyone is responsible for the quality and good it does. If we don't see something we need, 
    1. Ask us why this is so (there may or may not be a good reason)
    1. Build it 

## Who we are
We are a bunch of volunteers that care enough about civil rights to check our egos at the door and roll up our sleeves. 
* We don't have a ton of processes (yet) because we're still small enough to be flexible
* We do have good communication skills and ask for help when we need it, and get it
* We treat each other like friends even if we don't aggree with everyone's every last idea
* We care enough about the work to get it right, and do our best, whatever that means for our particular skillset 
* We care enough about ourselves and each to not force ourselves and each other to do work we don't want to do.

## Code of conduct

1. We figure out what information we need to know in order to get our task done.
    1. If we don't have a piece of information that we need -> we ask (email or [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1106301559811350540/1106302529194688623)).
    1. If we don't see the infrastructure we need to get our job done  -> we ask if there is a reason or if we should just build it 
1. We code review early. Code review often. We do not merge without a code review. 
    1. As we start a feature branch, check in with the team to see what unwritten requirements exist. I.e. follow [Gitlab Flow](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/version-control/what-is-gitlab-flow/)
    1. We follow good coding practices, including commenting code, delinting code, merging in from main early and often.
        1. Do not merge into main until it is polished code. 
        1. This may require asking for code reviews on feature branches for larger features.
        1. **If polishing a feature for merging is not what you are up for, that's okay. Tag it, and someone will get to it eventually.**
    1. We write tests for our features.
        1. All tests must pass before merging to main.
        1. All new features must have tests.
    1. All pull requests will be reviewed by at least to mainters before merge.
1. We respect our own and each other's time. 
    1. Don't go too far into a project without talking to maintainers.
        1. If we don't understand how someone else is working on a part of the problem -> we ask them. 
        1. If we don't know who else is working on a relevant part of the project -> we ask.
        1. When we need support on a project -> we schedule a time on someone else's calendar
        1. When someone asks for time and help -> we respond propmtly and be realistic about what support you can provide
    1. Avoid burnout. 
        1. We are realistic about our own schedule and time commitment 
        1. We take on tasks that bring us joy
            1. **If a task doesn't bring you joy, don't do it.**
            1. Document that it needs doing and move on. Someone else will get to it.
1. If we make a mistake, or think someone else has made a mistake, we talk about it.
