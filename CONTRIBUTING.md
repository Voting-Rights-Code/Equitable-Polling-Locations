# TL;DR
1. Communicate
    1. We can't fix a problem if we don't know it needs fixing.  
2. Everyone is responcible for the quality and good it does. If we don't see something we need, 
    1. Ask us why this is so (there may or may not be a good reason)
    1. Build it 


# Code of Conduct
Welcome to Voting Rights Code. Thank you for considering working with us. If you are just browsing, reach out. We'd love to talk to you. 

**Who we are**:
A bunch of volunteers that care enough about civil rights to check our egos at the door and roll up our sleeves. 
* We don't have a ton of processes (yet) because we're still figuring it out
* We do have good communication skills and ask for help when we need it, and get it
* We treat each other like friends even if we don't aggree with everyone's every last idea
* Care enough about the work to get it right, not just the 80% solution
* Care enough about ourselves and each to not force ourselves and each other to do work we don't want to do.

## Code of conduct

1. We figure out what information you need to know in order to get your task done.
    1. If we don't have a piece of information that you need -> we ask.
    1. If we don't see the infrastructure we need to get our job done  -> ask if there is a reason or if we should just build it 
1. Code review early. Code review often. Do not merge without a code review.
    1. As we start a feature branch, check in with the team to see what unwritten requirements exist
    1. Follow good coding practices, including commenting code, implementing tests, delinting code.
    1. Do not merge into main until it is polished code. 
        1. This may require asking for code reviews on feature branches for larger features.
        1. **If polishing a feature for merging is not what one is not up for, that's okay. Tag it, and someone will get to it eventually.**
    1. All pull requests will be reviewed by at least to mainters before merge.
1. We respect our own and each other's time. 
    1. Don't go too far into a project without checking in.
        1. If one doesn't understand how someone else is working on a part of the problem -> ask them. 
        1. If one doesn't know who else is working on a relevant part of the project -> ask.
        1. When we need support on a project -> schedule a time on someone else's calendar
        1. When someone asks for time and help -> respond propmtly and be realistic about what support you can provide
    1. Avoid burnout. 
        1. Be realistic about your own schedule and time commitment 
        1. Take on tasks that bring you joy
            1. **If a task doesn't bring you joy, don't do it.**
            1. Document that it needs doing and move on. Someone else will get to it.
1. If we make a mistake, or think someone else has made a mistake, talk about it.
