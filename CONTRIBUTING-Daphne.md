# Contributing to Voting Rights Code
Thank you for your interest in contributing!
Our contributing instructions are intentionally light because we are a small group of volunteers. Our goal is to get things done while maintaining a readable, well-functioning code base.

## What to work on 
1. We have a list of "tickets" in the `Issues` section of the repo that you can browse.
2. Before beginning, talk with the person who wrote the ticket be sure that you are  on the same page with respect to the requirements.

## Code requirements
#### Style
1. The primary style goal is straight forward, readable code.
2. Use descriptive names and comments to support readability
2. Refer to the  [Google Python style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) for naming conventions and other style pointers.

> *(I (Daphne) prefer [PEP 8 – Style Guide for Python Code](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/). I find it a easier to read and understand as a recreational coder. Dan suggested that we could also use some combination of Autopep8, black, isort, flake8, pylint, etc. before a push to get a consistent style.)*

> (*Two comment (SA):*
1. *I don't want to get too hung up on style guide, certainly not following someting to the letter.*
1. *Furthermore, there are things that don't see in pep8 or google that I like, such as descriptive variable names, removing debugging comments and internal notes before pushing to main, not doing computations in logging messages, or don't like about the above guides like (if foo: instead of if foo != 0)* 
    1. *I know I'm guilty of breaking some of these*
    1. *I don't feel strongly enough about this to get in the way*

#### Developing and merging changes
1. Create a new branch from `develop` to work in.
2. When your code is clean and ready, create a pull request to merge into `develop`.
3. After a thorough code-review, maintainers will merge into develop.
4. Merges into main will be performed via a release process.

> *This is really just a placeholder. I don't know what the process should be, but I think there should be one.*

## Communication is key
 - Our light contributing instructions function best with a heavy dose of communication.
 - If you have questions as you are working, please ask rather than forging ahead in uncertainty; email or [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1106301559811350540/1106302529194688623) works well to reach us quickly.

## Teamwork
- We are a small group of friends who are volunteering our time for a cause that we believe in. 
- We are respectful and value one anothers' time and contributions (including our own!).
- Thank you for considering joining our team!
